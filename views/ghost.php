    <p class="background_perso">You have been murdered. You are dead. This means you cannot talk with the others anymore. However, there is still a way for you to play. You cannot talk anymore, but you are allowed to listen, think (of course), touch (and move) objects, and share messages. You have tree opportunity to share information with the other players. Please be fair play, and only use the three pieces of paper provided to communicate with the other players, and not more. If you want to have a little bit of fun and give them enigmas or things to solve, feel free to do so. Now that you are dead, you are allowed to talk to the organizer and even ask him questions (make sure the other players canâ€™t hear you). The organizer is not required to answer you, but they cannot lie to you.</p>
